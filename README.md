# Clean Infrastructure Project

The Clean Infrastructure Project is an open-source initiative with a single underlying purpose. Empower everyone to **build better infrastructure** by producing and freely distributing world-class infrastructure code.

## What Is Clean Infrastructure

We believe a clean infrastructure design is one that follows these design principles:

- Is based on comprehensive architecture diagrams and well documented best-practice principles.
- Is deployed in a completely automated fashion using declarative infrastructure code.
-  Infrastructure code is comprehensively tested with automated unit and acceptance tests.
-  Composed of loosely coupled services with explicitly declared and isolated dependencies.
- Relies on disposable resources instead of fixed servers and embraces the principles of elasticity and scalability.
- Adheres to the least-privilege security model.

## What We Provide

The project aims to serve as a clearinghouse for infrastructure expertise and freely distributed infrastructure code that allows **everyone** to build and deploy secure, scalable and resilient cloud infrastructures.

With that goal in mind, we provide:

- World-class, reusable infrastructure modules that address all of your most common infrastructure problems.
- All modules are fully tested with comprehensive, automated unit and acceptance tests.
- All modules are backed by well documented best-practices and comprehensive architecture diagrams so you can understand why every design decision was made.
- All infrastructure code is based on architecture patterns and module designs proven in production at some of the worlds largest technology organizations.

## Who Are We

This project brings together experts in infrastructure engineering, distributed systems design, software engineering and infrastructure architecture.

During our day jobs, we work at extremely large technology companies, financial institutions and innovative startups and we all share a common passion for infrastructure development.

Every piece of code, every best-practice and every architecture diagram comes from years of experience running some of the worlds largest production AWS estates.

## Get Involved

Want to get involved? We're thrilled to have you join the project.

We're building a list of work and issues so check back often. In the meantime, send an email to info@cleaninfra.io and introduce yourself - we'll be happy to put you to work.
