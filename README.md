# Clean Infrastructure Project

The goal of the Clean Infrastructure Project is simple. Help everyone **build better infrastructure**.

The Clean Infrastructure Project will serve as a clearinghouse for world-class reusable infrastructure code, backed by well documented best-practices and robust architecture diagrams, that makes it quick and easy for **everyone** to deploy truly secure, scalable and resilient cloud infrastructure.

## Principles

This project starts with the premise that infrastructure code should be given the same care and attention as any other software development discipline.

Clean code matters. Every infrastructure module we develop adheres to the following principles:

- **If it isn't documented, it doesn't exist.**

  Design comes before coding. Every module and every decision made is backed by well documented best-practice principles and robust, easy to understand architecture diagrams.

- **Code quality counts.**

  Reading our modules should be a pleasant experience. Code is well organized, narrowly focused, cleanly separated and thoroughly commented.

- **Everything is tested.**

  Every module is backed by a suite of comprehensive and automated unit and acceptance tests. This means we can validate that our code complies with the requirements. We can maintain and extend it without worrying that it will stop working.

- **Customizable and Configurable.**

  Our modules have thoroughly documented input variables that allow you to easily customize and configure their behavior.

  Every module includes robust outputs giving you a highly composable system of modules that can be glued together to build comprehensive infrastructures.

## Who Are We

This project brings together experts in infrastructure engineering, distributed systems design, software engineering and infrastructure architecture.

During our day jobs, we work at extremely large technology companies, financial institutions and innovative startups and we all share a common passion for infrastructure development.

Every piece of code, every best-practice and every architecture diagram comes from years of experience running some of the worlds largest production AWS estates.
